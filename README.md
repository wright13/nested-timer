# Nested Timer

The goal of this project is to provide a timer app that allows the user to create one or more main timers and nest smaller timers within each main timer.

### Uses:
- Workouts
	- Interval training
	- Hangboard/rock ring sequences
- Cooking and baking
	- Complex recipes
	- Planning ahead so multiple dishes come out at the same time
